STUDENTS GRADES PREDICTIONS CONCLUSIONS as of 2022-02-25
School educational support has larger impact than family educational support.
Pass class failures seem to have meaningful impact on final grade.
Neither study time nor free time have much impact on grade.
Location related features seem to have smaller impact than education related ones.
Access to Internet doesn’t have much impact.
Combination of family relations, its size, educational support and parents’ cohabitation status seems to be unrelated to grades.
Parents’ education seems to have more impact than their current job, and apparently mother’s education and job > father’s, and no matter who student’s guardian is.
Alcohol consumption seems to have not much effect.
Participation in additional activities and learning after school has not much effect.
Personal features like sex, age, health have an effect on grades rather than a will to join extra-curricular activities or being in relationship.
